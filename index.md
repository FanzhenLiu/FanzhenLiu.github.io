<!-- subtitle: This is where I will tell my friends way too much about me -->
---

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Computing](https://www.mq.edu.au/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/departments-and-schools/school-of-computing), Macquarie University, Australia, supervised by [Dr. Jia Wu](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~jiawu/) and [Prof. Jian Yang](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~jian/). Previously, I obtained my M.Res. (Master of Research) from Macquarie University, Australia in 2020, and my B.E. from Southwest University, China in 2018.

My research interests include Data Mining, Graph Mining, Anomaly Detection, and Social Network Analysis.
